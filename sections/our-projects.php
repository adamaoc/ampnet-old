					<p>Holiday-Design is an online store that sells seasonal and holiday decorations. One of their main focuses was to have an easy to use shopping cart where they could add inventory and have it be displayed not just on their website but also on Facebook. We made that happen by integrating a smart and well knows shopping cart. The site itself had to be responsive so we chose to go with Bootstrap 3 as a base framework. Inventory is pulled in using the shopping cart's API so that we can keep the look, feel, and responsiveness our client needed.</p>

					<p>DFW Bellies and Babies is a very unique photography business that specializes in photographing childhood from the belly forward. They are dining a lot of innovative photography and wanted a site that would really show off their work. They also want to be able to blog alongside their work to constantly keep in touch with their clients and community. We built the site using WordPress as a backend tool. We built them a custom theme that is responsive and easily shows off all of their great work.</p>
